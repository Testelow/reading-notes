<sub>Growth mindset</sub> is the internal understanding that learning and growing intellectually and personally starts with your want to learn and increase your knowledge. It's the idea that you have to get comfortable with being uncomfortable I learned this saying in the Marine Corps ! Learning something new is not always easy but if you are able to put your best foot forward and continue to push through with persistance. I also believe that being patience and showing yourself grace is equally as important to the growth mindset. It is very easy to be hard on yourself when you don't learn something as fast as you would like but you have to be patient and give yourself time to take in all the new things you've learned.
